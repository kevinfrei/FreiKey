My fully custom ergonomic two piece Bluetooth keyboard. This is forked from the ErgoBlue repository. I'll add details about the keyboard after I get the firmware cleaned up.

Here's the keyboard in the
[Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/5c16e089cbf0f5d27975c1d949c1de67).
I've got both my work & home keyboards built now, so I'm going to start hacking on the firmware.
It's pretty twitchy, currently, and I'm not really happy with it.
I just don't feel like it's particularly accurate, or reliable...
